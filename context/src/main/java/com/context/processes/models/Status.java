 * <p>The fields are as follows:</p>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Name: Command run by this process.</li>
 * <li>State: Current state of the process.  One of "R (running)", "S (sleeping)", "D (disk
 * sleep)",
 * "T (stopped)", "T (tracing stop)", "Z (zombie)", or "X (dead)".</li>
 * <li>Tgid: Thread group ID (i.e., Process ID).</li>
 * <li>Pid: Thread ID (see gettid(2)).</li>
 * <li>PPid: PID of parent process.</li>
 * <li>TracerPid: PID of process tracing this process (0 if not being traced).</li>
 * <li>Uid, Gid: Real, effective, saved set, and filesystem UIDs (GIDs).</li>
 * <li>FDSize: Number of file descriptor slots currently allocated.</li>
 * <li>Groups: Supplementary group list.</li>
 * <li>VmPeak: Peak virtual memory size.</li>
 * <li>VmSize: Virtual memory size.</li>
 * <li>VmLck: Locked memory size (see mlock(3)).</li>
 * <li>VmPin: Pinned memory size (since Linux 3.2).  These are pages that can't be moved because
 * something needs to directly access physical memory.</li>
 * <li>VmHWM: Peak resident set size ("high water mark").</li>
 * <li>VmRSS: Resident set size.</li>
 * <li>VmData, VmStk, VmExe: Size of data, stack, and text segments.</li>
 * <li>VmLib: Shared library code size.</li>
 * <li>VmPTE: Page table entries size (since Linux 2.6.10).</li>
 * <li>VmPMD: Size of second-level page tables (since Linux 4.0).</li>
 * <li>VmSwap: Swapped-out virtual memory size by anonymous private pages; shmem swap usage is not
 * included (since Linux 2.6.34).</li>
 * <li>Threads: Number of threads in process containing this thread.</li>
 * <li>SigQ: This field contains two slash-separated numbers that relate to queued signals for the
 * real user ID of this process.  The first of these is the number of currently queued signals for
 * this real user ID, and the second is the resource limit on the number of queued signals for this
 * process (see the description of RLIMIT_SIGPENDING in getrlimit(2)).</li>
 * <li>SigPnd, ShdPnd: Number of signals pending for thread and for process as a whole (see
 * pthreads(7) and signal(7)).</li>
 * <li>SigBlk, SigIgn, SigCgt: Masks indicating signals being blocked, ignored, and caught (see
 * signal(7)).</li>
 * <li>CapInh, CapPrm, CapEff: Masks of capabilities enabled in inheritable, permitted, and
 * effective sets (see capabilities(7)).</li>
 * <li>CapBnd: Capability Bounding set (since Linux 2.6.26, see capabilities(7)).</li>
 * <li>Seccomp: Seccomp mode of the process (since Linux 3.8, see seccomp(2)). 0 means
 * SECCOMP_MODE_DISABLED; 1 means SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT; 2 means SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER. This field is
 * provided only if the kernel was built with the CONFIG_SECCOMP kernel configuration option
 * enabled.</li>
 * <li>Cpus_allowed: Mask of CPUs on which this process may run (since Linux 2.6.24, see
 * cpuset(7)).</li>
 * <li>Cpus_allowed_list: Same as previous, but in "list format" (since Linux 2.6.26, see
 * cpuset(7)).</li>
 * <li>Mems_allowed: Mask of memory nodes allowed to this process (since Linux 2.6.24, see
 * cpuset(7)).</li>
 * <li>Mems_allowed_list: Same as previous, but in "list format" (since Linux 2.6.26, see
 * cpuset(7)).
 * voluntary_ctxt_switches, nonvoluntary_ctxt_switches: Number of voluntary and involuntary context
 * switches (since Linux 2.6.23).</li>
