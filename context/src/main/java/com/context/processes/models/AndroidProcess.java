   * <p>/proc/[pid]/oom_score_adj (since Linux 2.6.36)</p>
   *
   * <p>This file can be used to adjust the badness heuristic used to select which process gets
   * killed in out-of-memory conditions.</p>
   *
   * <p>The badness heuristic assigns a value to each candidate task ranging from 0 (never kill) to
   * 1000 (always kill) to determine which process is targeted. The units are roughly a proportion
   * along that range of allowed memory the process may allocate from, based on an estimation of
   * its current memory and swap use. For example, if a task is using all allowed memory, its
   * badness score will be 1000.  If it is using half of its allowed memory, its score will be
   * 500.</p>
   *
   * <p>There is an additional factor included in the badness score: root processes are given 3%
   * extra memory over other tasks.</p>
   *
   * <p>The amount of "allowed" memory depends on the context in which the OOM-killer was called.
   * If it is due to the memory assigned to the allocating task's cpuset being exhausted, the
   * allowed memory represents the set of mems assigned to that cpuset (see cpuset(7)). If it is
   * due to a mempolicy's node(s) being exhausted, the allowed memory represents the set of
   * mempolicy nodes. If it is due to a memory limit (or swap limit) being reached, the allowed
   * memory is that configured limit. Finally, if it is due to the entire system being out of
   * memory, the allowed memory represents all allocatable resources.</p>
   *
   * <p>The value of oom_score_adj is added to the badness score before it is used to determine
   * which task to kill.  Acceptable values range from -1000 (OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MIN) to +1000
   * (OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MAX). This allows user space to control the preference for OOM-killing, ranging
   * from always preferring a certain task or completely disabling it from OOM killing.  The lowest
   * possible value, -1000, is equivalent to disabling OOM- killing entirely for that task, since
   * it will always report a badness score of 0.</p>
   *
   * <p>Consequently, it is very simple for user space to define the amount of memory to consider
   * for each task.  Setting a oom_score_adj value of +500, for example, is roughly equivalent to
   * allowing the remainder of tasks sharing the same system, cpuset, mempolicy, or memory
   * controller resources to use at least 50% more memory.  A value of -500, on the other hand,
   * would be roughly equivalent to discounting 50% of the task's allowed memory from being
   * considered as scoring against the task.</p>
   *
   * <p>For backward compatibility with previous kernels, /proc/[pid]/oom_adj can still be used to
   * tune the badness score.  Its value is scaled linearly with oom_score_adj.</p>
   *
   * <p>Writing to /proc/[pid]/oom_score_adj or /proc/[pid]/oom_adj will change the other with its
   * scaled value.</p>

   * <li>Threads: Number of threads in process containing this thread.</li>
   * <li>SigQ: This field contains two slash-separated numbers that relate to queued signals for
   * the
   * real user ID of this process.  The first of these is the number of currently queued signals
   * for
   * this real user ID, and the second is the resource limit on the number of queued signals for
   * this
   * process (see the description of RLIMIT_SIGPENDING in getrlimit(2)).</li>

   * <li>CapBnd: Capability Bounding set (since Linux 2.6.26, see capabilities(7)).</li>
   * <li>Seccomp: Seccomp mode of the process (since Linux 3.8, see seccomp(2)). 0 means
   * SECCOMP_MODE_DISABLED; 1 means SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT; 2 means SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER. This field is
   * provided only if the kernel was built with the CONFIG_SECCOMP kernel configuration option
   * enabled.</li>
